# Deep Analysis: Data Structures & Algorithms for Big Tech Interviews

## Overview

Based on my analysis of thousands of coding interview questions from FAANG+ companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, and top startups), I've identified the critical topics you need to master.

This repository is divided into two main guides:

###  [Data Structures Guide](./DATA_STRUCTURES.md)
A comprehensive guide covering Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Tries, Union-Find, and Advanced Data Structures.

###  [Algorithms Guide](./ALGORITHMS.md)
A complete guide covering Sorting, Searching, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Divide & Conquer, Graph Algorithms, Binary Search Variations, Bit Manipulation, Math, Interval Problems, and Advanced Algorithms.
